const sentance = "Computer sciense is the study of computation, algorithms, and how computers process information. " +
    "It encompasses a wide range of topics, from the theoretical foundations of programming languages and algorithms to " +
    "practical applications in software engineering and artificial intelligence. One key area in computer sciense" +
    " is data structures, which are used to store and organize data efficiently, allowing for faster processing and " +
    "retrieval. Another vital aspect is algorithms, which are sets of instructions that enable computers to solve " +
    "complex problems quickly and effectively. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and artificial " +
    "intelligence have revolutionized the field, allowing computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions" +
    " without explicit programming. Computer sciense also plays a critical role in cybersecurity, helping protect " +
    "sensitive information from unauthorized access. As technology continues to evolve, the demand for skilled computer " +
    "scientists grows, with applications in almost every industry. From healthcare to finance, entertainment, and beyond, " +
    "computer sciense is essential in driving innovation, solving global challenges, and shaping the future of human " +
    "progress. Itâ€™s a field that requires logical thinking, problem solving skills, and a deep understanding of how " +
    "technology can be leveraged to make the world more connected and efficient."
